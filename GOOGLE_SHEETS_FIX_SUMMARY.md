# Google Sheets Integration - Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: Chatbot Reading SQL Database Instead of Google Sheets ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- The chatbot was querying the SQLite database (Django's internal tables like `auth_user`, `auth_group`, etc.) instead of reading data from your Google Sheet
- When asked "could you summarize the database?", it showed Django's auth tables instead of your project data

**Root Cause:**
- The `.env` file had `USE_SQL_DATABASE=True`, which instructed the chatbot to use the SQL database
- The chatbot service checks this setting in `chatbot_service.py` to decide which data source to use

**Solution:**
Changed in `.env`:
```bash
# Before:
USE_SQL_DATABASE=True

# After:
USE_SQL_DATABASE=False
```

**Verification:**
✅ Ran `test_google_sheets.py` which confirmed:
- Successfully connected to Google Sheets API
- Retrieved data from 8 worksheets (Projects, Members, Stakeholders, Risks, TimeTracking, Issues, BudgetDetails, Milestones)
- Total of 121 rows across all sheets
- Chatbot service successfully integrated with Google Sheets

---

### Issue 2: Database Constraint Error ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
```
UNIQUE constraint failed: chatbot_chatanalytics.user_id, chatbot_chatanalytics.date
```

**Root Cause:**
- The `ChatAnalytics` model had `date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)` which automatically sets the date when created
- When using `get_or_create()`, if there was a race condition or timing issue, it could try to create duplicate records
- The error handling wasn't catching this constraint violation

**Solutions Applied:**

1. **Updated `chatbot/models.py`:**
   - Changed `date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)` to `date = models.DateField()`
   - Added database index for better performance: `indexes = [models.Index(fields=['user', 'date'])]`

2. **Updated `chatbot/views.py`:**
   - Added proper error handling with try-except around analytics updates
   - Added explicit `defaults` parameter to `get_or_create()` to ensure proper initialization
   - Errors in analytics tracking no longer cause the entire chat request to fail

3. **Created and applied migration:**
   - `chatbot/migrations/0004_alter_chatanalytics_date_and_more.py`
   - Successfully applied to the database

## Current Configuration

### Google Sheets Setup ✅
- **Service Account:** pm-chatbot-gemini@gen-lang-client-0656398844.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- **Credentials File:** `gen-lang-client-0656398844-74b5a2aa583c.json`
- **Sheet ID:** `1e4eG8PwQeNfJdY_5-DcjYJA_WnCSkTdObFk_Tlq_JTI`
- **Worksheets:** 8 (Projects, Members, Stakeholders, Risks, TimeTracking, Issues, BudgetDetails, Milestones)

### Data Available to Chatbot
Your chatbot now has access to:
- **5 Projects** with budget and status information
- **15 Team Members** across projects
- **15 Stakeholders** with engagement strategies
- **13 Risk Items** with mitigation plans
- **20 Time Tracking Entries**
- **12 Issues** being tracked
- **20 Budget Detail Items**
- **21 Milestones**

## Testing the Fix

### You Can Now Ask Questions Like:

1. **"How many projects are there?"**
   - Should return: 5 projects

2. **"Could you summarize the database?"**
   - Should describe the 8 worksheets and their content (NOT Django's auth tables)

3. **"What's the status of our projects?"**
   - Should list the 5 projects and their statuses

4. **"Show me budget information"**
   - Should pull from the BudgetDetails worksheet

5. **"List all team members"**
   - Should show the 15 members from the Members worksheet

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart the Django Server
```powershell
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Then restart:
cd "c:\Users\Avishek Paul\pm_chatbot"
python manage.py runserver
# Or for WebSocket support:
daphne project_chatbot.asgi:application -p 8000
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
- Clear any cached data in your browser
- Or use Ctrl+F5 to hard refresh

### 3. Test the Chatbot
Try asking:
- "How many projects are there?"
- "Summarize the database"
- "What projects do we have?"

## Additional Improvements Made

### Error Handling
- Analytics errors no longer crash the chat
- Better error messages for database issues
- Graceful fallback if Google Sheets is unavailable

### Performance
- Added database index on `(user, date)` for ChatAnalytics
- Maintained cache support for Google Sheets data (5-minute default)

### Testing
- Created `test_google_sheets.py` for easy connection verification
- Test script shows all worksheets and row counts

---

## Troubleshooting

### If the Chatbot Still Shows Wrong Data:

1. **Verify the server is using the new .env settings:**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\Avishek Paul\pm_chatbot"
   python test_google_sheets.py
   ```
   Should show `USE_SQL_DATABASE: False`

2. **Clear the cache:**
   - Click the "Refresh Data" button in the chatbot UI
   - Or manually clear Django's cache

3. **Check Google Sheets permissions:**
   - Make sure the sheet is shared with: `pm-chatbot-gemini@gen-lang-client-0656398844.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Sheet should have at least "Viewer" access

4. **Verify API key:**
   - Check that `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
   - Currently: `AIzaSyCIBxVMCJ8YGnuf_suwWWg1mfFS1hPRb7k`

## Summary

Both issues have been resolved:
✅ Chatbot now reads from Google Sheets (not SQL database)
✅ Database constraint error fixed with proper error handling
✅ All tests passing
